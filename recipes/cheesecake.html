    <ul>
        <li>Oreos: This recipe starts with a package of Oreos.</li>
        <li>Butter: Half a stick of salted butter lends richness and flavor.</li>
        <li>Cream cheese: Of course, you'll need softened cream cheese for these cream cheese bars. </li>
        <li>Sugar: A cup of white sugar lends the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Sour cream: Sour cream adds creaminess and subtle tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Three eggs give the bars richness and help bind the batter together. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt also enhances the flavor, but it won't make the bars taste salty. </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Pulse the cookies in a food processor. Pulse again with butter.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture into a prepared pan and bake until set.</li>
        <li>Make the filling, pour the batter onto the crust, and sprinkle with cookie crumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake until the filling is set, cool, and chill.</li>
        <li>Cut the Oreo cheesecake bars into squares. </li>
